A distributed database is formed of a number of individual machines.  The aggregate storage capacity, and read and write throughput, of the distributed database is less than or equal to the sum of what each individual machine can offer in terms of its throughput or storage capacity.  This ratio of input resources versus resulting cluster throughput is our Resource Efficiency, and is greatly affected by the choice of replication algorithm.

Introduction
- Three algorithms:
  - Leadered consensus
    - Academia: Majority Quorums, Raft, Multi-Paxos, ZAB
    - Industry: CockroachDB, TiDB, Google Chubby, Zookeeper
  - Leaderless consensus
    - Academia: the majority of Paxos flavors (paxos, egalitarian paxos)
    - Industry: Megastore, PaxosStore
  - Not consensus
    - Academia: Vertical Paxos II, CRAQ, PacificA, Hermes
    - Industry: Kafka ISR, FoundationDB, Apache Pegasus, there used to be chain replication databases but they all died out (hyperdex, hibari)

When deploying a distributed database, one forms a cluster of machines stem:[X], each of which can individually deliver a read throughput stem:[R_X], write throughput stem:[W_X], and has available storage capacity stem:[S_X].  The resulting overall database system stem:[Y] can be benchmarked to determine its read throughput stem:[R_Y], write throughput stem:[W_Y] and storage capacity stem:[S_Y].  Throughout this post, we'll be examining what each class of replication algorithms can deliver in terms of the maximum values for read throughput efficiency stem:[R_Y / R_X], write throughput efficiency stem:[W_Y / W_X], and storage capacity efficiency stem:[S_Y / S_X].  As a counterpoint to resource efficiency, we'll also be looking at availability: given the loss of a random machine, what's the chance that a user will observe a transient service disruption?

This post is also one that lives purely in the land of theory.  All implementation efficiency costs are handwaved as negligible, which is blatantly false as evidenced by e.g. Red Panda being more resource efficient in aggregate than Kafka.  In the "write bandwidth efficiency" above, we're only concerning ourself with the network bandwidth.  Storage efficiency also captures the disk write bandwidth efficiency, as storing 3 copies of data requires writing 3 copies of data.  However, it's tremendously more likely that in a real production deployment, the bottleneck for writes will be the disk and not the network.  We're discussing the theoretical tradeoffs only.

The data replication algorithms examined fall across two categories: those designed to quietly tolerate failing nodes (failure masking), and those necessitating explicit reconfiguration around failures (failure detection).  We'll be examining leaderless replication for failure masking algorithms, and chain replication for failure detection algorithms.  Algorithms also exist between these two extremes, such as leaderful consensus which requires detecting failures only for the leader, and masks failures for the followers.

Leaderful consensus what is generally brought to mind when one mentions "consensus".  It is best known as <<Raft>>, <<MultiPaxos>> or <<ZAB>>, and exemplified by distributed databases such as <<CockroachDB>>, <<TiDB>> and <<Spanner>>, or configuration management systems such as <<PaxosMadeLive>> and <<Zookeeper>>.  (Among _many_ other high-quality, production systems.)

The best known leaderless replication algorithms are the Paxos family of protocols.  They do not need to be consensus though, and majority quorums (with <<ReadRepair>>^[1]^
[.aside]#[1]: This post accidentally turned into an interesting adventure into finding the correct citation for a number of common concepts.  This is the first, and by no means the last, citation where the source paper tangentially introduced a now fundamental concept.#
) or <<ABD>> are also in this category.  Leaderless replication is used in industry by systems like <<Megastore>> and <<PaxosStore>>, and <<Cassandra>>.

Lastly, there is the lesser known class of failure detection-based replication algorithms.  These are algorithms in which there is a set of nodes in a replication group, and on detected failure, these algorithms execute a _view change_ to reconfigure to a new set of nodes with no failures.  There's a broad examination of such distributed protocols stemming from <<VirtualSynchrony>>, and this perspective of view changes on detected failures is even present in consensus protocols such as <<ViewstampedReplication>>. However, our dividing line for this analysis is that the failure-detection algorithms use stem:[f+1] nodes to tolerate stem:[f] failures.  If stem:[2f+1] nodes are required, then the algorithm is likely better covered by one of the two failure-masking classes of algorithms discussed above.  For example, Viewstamped Replication is very much like Raft and Multi-Paxos.

As a consequence of only having stem:[f+1] nodes for stem:[f] failures, there is a consistent theme in that all algorithms examined are _not consensus_.  This also means that they cannot solve consensus problems, such as deciding which replicas are responsible for a shard of data, or which node is the primary.  They all rely on an external consensus service to help with those issues.  Think of this as a control plane / data plane split: there's one instance of a consensus service in the control plane orchestrating the small amount of metadata deciding which nodes are in which replication groups responsible for which shards of data, and the horizontally scaleable data plane replicates each shard of data within its assigned group.

There's two shapes of algorithms in this class of failure detection replication protocols: those that look like some form of primary-backup replication where a leader fans out requests to one or more backup nodes, or chain replication-like algorithms where each node is responsible for forwarding each piece of replicated data to the next node in the chain.  In academia, evolving Paxos into a reconfigurable primary-backup replication was examined in <<VerticalPaxosII>>. <<PacificA>> and <<Hermes>> are more recent but different views on reconfigurable primary-backup replication. <<CRAQ>> is the most famous chain replication algorithm, with <<HyperDex>> being a more recently proposed chain-based system.  In industry, <<Kafka>> and <<FoundationDB>>^[2]^[.aside]#[2]: Disclaimer: former affiliation.# use different variants of reconfigurable primary-backup, {uri-apache-pegasus}[Apache Pegasus] uses PacificA.  Nearly all of the chain replication databases in industry have died out, as {uri-hibari}[hibari] was one of the last but appears abandoned now, and HyperDex almost become a startup.

All of this analysis is building to one core, yet obvious point: failure detection's stem:[f+1] is less than failure masking's stem:[2f+1].  Superficially, that's 40% more resources to accomplish the same task (for the common stem:[f=2]).  But how does that compare after we take the algorithm's resource efficiency into account?  Do the benefits of a leadered failure masking protocol like Raft outweigh the detriments, as opposed to leaderless consensus?

////
 [.aside]#[^1]: Note that majority quorums require read repair to be linearizable, but even so, it's a weaker linearizability than what Paxos or Raft provide.  Majority quorums are only linearizable if failed operations are considered to never complete (thus never time out), whereas Raft is linearizable even with failures.#

Despite being 66% more costly to operate, failure masking algorithms are the overwhelming choice in industry, with the most common choice offering the worst resource efficiency tradeoff.


Raft requires stem:[2f+1] nodes to handle stem:[f] failures, whereas Chain Replication requires stem:[f+1] nodes.  Raft is correspondingly 60% more expensive to run for the commonly deployed case of stem:[f=2], and offers worse availability than leaderless consensus.

These correlate to algorithms that require stem:[2f+1] nodes (e.g. Raft and Paxos) to tolerate stem:[f] failures versus those that require stem:[f+1] nodes (e.g. Chain Replication and Kafka ISR), respectively.  The former class of algorithms has seen significantly more industry use, but comes at a significant cost.

Ideally, a database hosted across 5 machines would be able to store 5x the data,
with 5x the read and write throughput, and 5x the fault tolerance.  Chain
replication and leaderless consensus strike optimal tradeoffs at opposite ends,
with Raft languishing in the middle.

== Raft / Multi-Paxos

:uri-cockroach-follower-reads: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/follower-reads-stale-data/
:uri-tikv-follower-reads: https://tikv.org/blog/double-system-read-throughput/
:uri-edb-pgdist-witness: https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/node_management/witness_nodes/

:uri-tigerbeetle-fpaxos: https://docs.tigerbeetle.com/deploy/hardware/

In the simplest Raft implementation, all operations sent to the leader, and the leader broadcasts the replication stream to its followers.  Tolerating stem:[f=2] failures requires stem:[2f+1 = 5] nodes.  All nodes store and write the same data to disk.  At most two of the replicas are permitted to be unavailable.  Across any and all flavors of Raft and Multi-Paxos, the presence of a leader is fundamental, and gives a 1 in 5 chance of transient unavailability if a node fails.

[graphviz]

digraph G {
  Client -> Leader   [dir=both];
  Leader -> Replica1 [dir=both];
  Leader -> Replica2 [dir=both];
  Leader -> Replica3 [dir=both, style=dashed];
  Leader -> Replica4 [dir=both, style=dashed];
}
----

In Raft, all replicas store the same data, and thus 1/5th of the total storage capacity is available post-replication.    There are a wide set of storage optimizations that have all seen little adoption in industry.  <<WitnessReplicas>> permit removing the majority of the storage from 2/5ths of the replication group, and only {uri-edb-pgdist-witness}[EnterpriseDB Postgres Distributed] and (Cloud) <<Spanner>> implement support for them.  The other possible direction for storage efficiency improvement is <<ErasureEncodedRaft>>.  Erasure encoding is popular in distributed filesystems and blob storage systems, but incredibly rare in distributed databases; I am only aware of {uri-ydb-erasure-encode}[YDB] using it.  Applying <<FlexiblePaxos>> allows one to run with 4 replicas and require 3 to be alive for an election but only replicate across 2.  We're using stem:[f=2] as our comparison baseline, and that's a half way point between stem:[f=1] and stem:[f=2] that doesn't compare equally to anything else, but it is an option which as far as I know only {uri-tigerbeetle-fpaxos}[TigerBeetle] implements.  Thus, as 99% of the Raft implementations one might ever encounter have a storage efficiency of 1/5th, that is the value that will be used for storage efficiency for the rest of the analysis.

Read throughput can be improved by implementing <<LinearizableQuorumReads>> for 2/5ths read throughput, <<PaxosQuorumLeases>> for 3/5ths read throughput, or <<FollowerReads>> for 5/5ths read throughput at the cost of increased latency.  We'll disregard the latency implications, and keep 5/5ths as Raft's read throughput, which is realistic given that it's been implemented in production systems such as {uri-cockroach-follower-reads}[Cockroach] and {uri-tikv-follower-reads}[TiKV].

In classic Raft, the leader broadcasts the proposals to all followers.  This leaves the bottleneck as the leader's outgoing bandwidth, and establishes a maximum of stem:[1/2f], so 1/4th.  There have been ways discussed to scale the write bandwidth.  <<PullBasedConsensus>> presents an argument that a fixed topology is not needed, replicas can fetch from other replicas, and thus even a linear chain replicas could work.  <<ScalingReplication>> shows another view that the work of broadcasting to all replicas can be delegated to other replicas.  <<CommutativeRaft>> presents a different approach, in which clients are allowed to directly send to all replicas, and the leader only arbitrates ordering when there's conflicts.  Of these, only pull-based consensus is implemented in industry, but I'm not aware that even MongoDB itself runs in a linear chain configuration.  (It's mostly about saving WAN costs.)  Thus, 1/4th is the value that will be used for write bandwidth efficiency for the rest of the analysis.

A theoretical, maximally resource efficient Raft implementation could combine <<FollowerReads>> (enabling all replicas to provide full read throughput), <<PullBasedConsensus>> (to set up a chain-organized replication stream), and <<WitnessReplicas>> (to store only 3 full copies of data).

In summary, our resource efficiency for stem:[f=2] for a minimal Raft implementation, Raft with the set of improvements that one will commonly encounter in industry, and our theoretical and maximally resource efficient Raft is:

== Leaderless Paxos / Majority Quorums

While leaderless Paxos and majority quorums differ in terms of consistency guarantees, they're very similar in terms of resource efficiency.  Tolerating stem:[f=2] failures requires stem:[2f+1=5] nodes.  All nodes store the same data.  Writes are broadcast to all replicas and require a majority of responses.  Reads are broadcast to all replicas and require a majority of responses.

  Client -> Replica1 [dir=both];
  Client -> Replica2 [dir=both];
  Client -> Replica3 [dir=both];
  Client -> Replica4 [dir=both, style=dashed];
  Client -> Replica5 [dir=both, style=dashed];
}
----

There's a much smaller variety of optimizations for leaderless replication algorithms.

<<WitnessReplicas>> applies again, and allows storing only the log of most recent changes on 2 of the 5 nodes, thus bringing our storage efficiency from 20% to ~33%.

<<RSPaxos>> examines applying erasure encoding to Paxos log entries, and concludes that space savings can only be obtained if fault tolerance is sacrificed.  For the
The most fun optimization is applying erasure encoding to the quorums.

The major advantage of leaderless, quorum-based algorithms is the lack of dependence on a leader.  As opposed to Raft and Multi-Paxos, the chance of unavailability on failure is 0%.  There are no leader leases which must first time out, or any reconfiguration step which needs to be done.

////
If you have a raft/multi-paxos implementation already, one could change it into something f+1 rather easily:
1. Implement <<PaxosQuorumLeases>>, so that you nominate 3 of the 5 nodes as required for writes but also able to serve reads independently.
2. Move the logic for election to rely on an consensus group.
3. Reduce the quorum from 3 of 5 nodes to 3 of 3 nodes.
////

== Conclusion



Raft blends the worst aspects of Failure Masking (poor read/write throughput efficiency and poor storage efficiency) with the worst aspects of Failure Detection (transient unavailability on failure) into one replication algorithm that's consistently mediocre.
