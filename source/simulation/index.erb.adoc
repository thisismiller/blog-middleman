= Simulation Testing
:page-date: 2022-02-22
:page-layout: index

Simulation testing is simulating a distributed cluster of machines and processes entirely within a single local process.  This permits comprehensive testing of complex systems through fuzzed fault injection.  Single process execution allows for simulation to be deterministic, thus greatly improving debuggablity of complex failures.
